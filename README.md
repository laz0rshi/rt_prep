# Laz0rshi Guide

_I am creating this as a guide for my both my **OSCP** exam and for personal references to guide me through red team engagements._

They are broken down into personal runbooks, useful runbooks, references, scripts and tools.

Runbooks are my way of walking thought step by step on what I need to do for the given task. The theory behind them comes from ansible playbooks.  Some of these runbooks, probably could be automated,  but have not dedicated the time to do so.  They may also reference scripts that I created to be better prepared for for an engagement.  
Ex. Initial_setup will walk me though everything I need to do to take a fresh install of kali linux, and get it ready to how I like it set up.  

``` python

                 / \
/vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv  \------------------------------------------------------------,
`^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  /==========================================================="
                 \ /
```

## Personal Runbooks

These are runbooks that I created.  I may have barrow sections from others.  I would not recommend you copying these, validate your own methodology.  

## References

## Scripts and Tools

Theses are scripts that I created to help me in some of this process.  

## Useful Runbooks

<!--I recommend beginners look at the [references](#references). These courses and videos helped me gain fundamental knowledge for the OSCP exam and pentesting in general.

Also, I added links to original repositories and/or authors of the [utilities](#utilities) I use. I compiled a list of utilities that I prefer, but you must compile/download them yourself. -->
