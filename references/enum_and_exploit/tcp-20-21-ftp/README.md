* [Initial enumeration](#initial-enumeration)
* [Connecting to and enumerating an FTP server](#connecting-to-and-enumerating-an-ftp-server)
* [Uploading files](#uploading-files)

## Initial enumeration
```bash
nmap -vv -p 20,21 -sT --script=+ftp* <ip>
```

## Connecting to and enumerating an FTP server
- Connect to the FTP server:
```bash
ftp <ip> # Try common creds: anonymous:, anonymous:anonymous, ftp:ftp
```
- Bypass a firewall:
```bash
passive
```
- Enumerate files and folders:
```bash
ls -a # Always list hidden files as well
cd <path>

binary # To download binary files
ascii

get <filename>
```

## Uploading files
```bash
binary # To upload binary files
ascii

put <filename> 
```
